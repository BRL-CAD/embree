/**
   
   \brief Builds a ray tracing acceleration structure

   The zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt function builds an acceleration
   structure of the scene consisting of the specified geometry
   descriptors and writes the acceleration structure to the provided
   destination buffer. All types of geometries can get freely mixed
   inside a scene. Please see ze_raytracing_build_accel_ext_desc_t for
   a description of all input arguments.

   It is the users responsibility to manage the acceleration structure
   buffer allocation, deallocation, and potential prefetching to the
   device memory. The required size of the accleration structure
   buffer can be queried with the zeRaytracingGetAccelSizeExt
   function. The acceleration structure buffer must be a shared USM
   allocation and should be present on the host at build time. The
   referenced scene data (index and vertex buffers) can be standard
   host allocations, and will not be referenced into by the build
   acceleration structure.
   
   Before an accleration structure is build, the user has to use the
   zeRaytracingGetAccelSize function to query the size of the
   acceleration structure and scratch space buffer to allocate. When
   using the worst case size to allocate the acceleration structure
   buffer, then the zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt function will never fail
   with an out of memory error. When using the expected size for the
   acceleration structure buffer, then the build may fail with
   ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_RETRY_BUILD_ACCEL and should then get
   re-tried with a larger amount of data. Using the
   accelBufferBytesOut argument, the build itself returns an improved
   size estimate which the user can use to re-try the build.
   
   The acceleration structure build is executed on the host CPU and is
   synchronous, thus after the function returns with ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS
   the acceleration structure can get used. All provided data buffers
   have to be accessible from the host, thus no device memory can get
   passed. Unified shared memory has to get used for the acceleration
   structure buffer, for the builder to be able to write to it and the
   device to read from that buffer. 

   The constructed accleration structure is self contained, thus does
   not require the provided build data to be present after the build
   is done.

   The constructed acceleration structure cannot get copied into a
   different memory buffer as it may contain pointers.

   The acceleration build operation can get parallelized by passing a
   parallel operation and joining that parallel operation using the
   zeRaytracingParallelOperationJoinExt call with user provided worker
   threads. When a parallel operation is provided the
   zeRaytracingGetAccelSizeExt function returns with result
   ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_OPERATION_DEFERRED to indicate that the
   build operation is still in progress. The return value of the
   zeRaytracingParallelOperationJoinExt function determines the status
   of the parallel acceleration structure build.
